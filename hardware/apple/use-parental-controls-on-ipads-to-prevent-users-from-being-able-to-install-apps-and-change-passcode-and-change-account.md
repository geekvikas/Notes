# Use Parental Controls on iPads to Prevent Users from Being Able to Install Apps and Change Passcode and Change Account

## Problem
* There are about 20 iPads(iPad Pro 2020) shared by many users(maybe students) with one shared Apple ID(Admin's)
* Need to prevent users from being able to install apps, change passcode, change account...

## Solution
Use "Parent Controls" on the iPads

* Select 1 iPad
* Go to "Settings" > "Screen Time"
* Tap Continue > "This is My Child's Device"
* Create the "Screen Time" passcode
* You'll be asked to enter a new Apple ID other than the one logged on the iPad. It's used to reset the "Screen Time" passcode if you forget it
* Prevent iTunes & App Store purchases
  * Tap "iTunes & App Store Purchases"
    * Installing Apps > Don't Allow
    * Deleting Apps >  Don't Allow
    * in-app Purchases > Don't Allow
* Prevent Passcode Changes and Accont Changes
  * Tap "Content & Privacy Restrictions"
    * Passcode Changes > Don't Allow
    * Account Changes > Don't Allow

* After the first iPad's settings are completed, you only need to activate the "Screen Time" on other 19 iPads
  * Go to "Settings" > "Screen Time"
  * Tap Continue > "This is My Child's Device"
  * Create the "Screen Time" passcode
  * Enter the same Apple ID as the first iPad 

* Then all your settings(include passcode) will be synchronized due to the same Apple ID
