# Github Recovery Code Can Not Be Reused

> Once you use a recovery code to regain access to your account, it cannot be reused.
> If you've used all 16 recovery codes, you can generate another list of codes. 
> Generating a new set of recovery codes will invalidate any codes you previously generated.
