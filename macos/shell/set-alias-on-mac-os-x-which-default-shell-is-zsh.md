# Set alias on Mac OS X which its Default Shell is zsh

## Problem
* Set alias for `ls` to `ls -Glh` in `~/.profile` does NOT work on Mac OS X 10.15.4(Catalina)

## Root Cause
* Apple change default shell to zsh in Mac OS X 10.15

## Solution
* Use `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bashrc`
* Use `~/.zprofile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`
